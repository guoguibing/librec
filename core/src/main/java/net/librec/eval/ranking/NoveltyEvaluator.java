 *
 * Javari, Amin, and Mahdi Jalili. "A probabilistic model to resolve diversityâ€“accuracy challenge of recommendation systems." Knowledge and Information Systems 44.3 (2015): 609-627.
 *
 *
 * Calculates Self-Information of each recommender result list.
 * And then calculates the average of this of all result lists in test set.
 *
 * But please take also attention to the assumed probability space:
 *
 * The probability of an item is assumed to be the purchase probability.
 * (Estimated by items purchased divided by all items purchased.)
 * Surely there is also independence assumed between items.
 *
 * This assumption about the probability space is different from the EntropyEvaluator
