/**
 * EntropyEvaluator
 *
 * This is a 'Diversity'-Measure, but not necessarily a 'Novelty' or 'Surprisal'-Measure.
 *
 * Look at Section '4.2.3 Item space coverage' of article:
 *
 * Javari, Amin, and Mahdi Jalili. "A probabilistic model to resolve diversityâ€“accuracy challenge of recommendation systems." Knowledge and Information Systems 44.3 (2015): 609-627.
 *
 *
 * Calculates the Entropy within all recommender result list.
 *
 * But please take also attention to the assumed probability space:
 *
 * The probability of an item is assumed to be the probability to be in an recommendation result list.
 * (Estimated by count of this item in all reco list divided by the count of reco lists)
 *
 * This assumption about the probability space is different from the NoveltyEvaluator
