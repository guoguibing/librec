**LibRec** (http://www.librec.net) is a Java library for recommender systems (Java version 1.7 or higher required). It implements a suit of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms, aiming to resolve two classic recommendation tasks: **rating prediction** and **item ranking**.

### LibRec Demo
A movie recommender system is designed and [available here](http://demo.librec.net).

### Documentation
Please refer to [LibRec Documentation](http://wiki.librec.net) and [API Documentation](http://librec.net/doc/librec-v2.0/)

### Authors Words about the NEW Version
It has been a year since the last version was released. In this year, lots of changes have been taken to the LibRec project, and the most significant one is the formulation of the LibRec team. The team pushes forward the development of LibRec with the wisdom of many experts, and the collaboration of experienced and enthusiastic contributors. Without their great efforts and hardworking, it is impossible to reach the state that a single developer may dream of. 

LibRec 2.0 is not the end of our teamwork, but just the begining of greater objectives. We aim to continously provide NEXT versions for better experience and performance. There are many directions and goals in plan, and we will do our best to make them happen. It is always exciting to receive any code contributions, suggestions, comments from all our LibRec users. 

We hope you enjoy the new version!

### Features

* **Rich Algorithms:** More than 70 recommendation algorithms have been implemented, and more will be done.
* **High Modularity:** Six main components including data split, data conversion, similarity, algorithms, evaluators and filters.
* **Great Performance:** More efficient implementations than other counterparts while producing comparable accuracy.
* **Flexible Configuration:** Low coupling, flexible and either external textual or internal API configuration.
* **Simple Usage:** Can get executed in a few lines of codes, and a number of demos are provided for easy start.
* **Easy Expansion:** A set of recommendation interfaces for easy expansion to implement new recommenders.

### Execution 
You can run LibRec with configurations from command arguments:

<pre>
librec rec -exec -D rec.recommender.class=itemcluster -D rec.pgm.number=10 -D rec.iterator.maximum=20
</pre>

or from a configuration file:

<pre>
librec rec -exec -conf itemcluster-test.properties
</pre>

### Code Snippet

You can use **LibRec** as a part of your projects, and use the following codes to run a recommender. 

<pre>
public void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
	
	// recommender configuration
	Configuration conf = new Configuration();
	Resource resource = new Resource("rec/cf/userknn-test.properties");
	conf.addResource(resource);

	// build data model
	DataModel dataModel = new TextDataModel(conf);
	dataModel.buildDataModel();
	
	// set recommendation context
	RecommenderContext context = new RecommenderContext(conf, dataModel);
	RecommenderSimilarity similarity = new PCCSimilarity();
	similarity.buildSimilarityMatrix(dataModel, true);
	context.setSimilarity(similarity);

	// training
	Recommender recommender = new UserKNNRecommender();
	recommender.recommend(context);

	// evaluation
	RecommenderEvaluator evaluator = new MAEEvaluator();
	recommender.evaluate(evaluator);

	// recommendation results
	List<RecommendedItem> recommendedItemList = recommender.getRecommendedList();
	RecommendedFilter filter = new GenericRecommendedFilter();
	recommendedItemList = filter.filter(recommendedItemList);
}
</pre>
