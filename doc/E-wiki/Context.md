# Librec
LibRec (http://www.librec.net) is an advanced Java open source library of recommender systems with around 70 multiple recommendation algorithms, which can effectively solve the rating and ranking problems. Recommender system is a typical application of Machine Learning and Big Data, which is used to provide personalized recommendations. As an implementation of recommendation algorithms, LibRec 2.0.0-RC improves a lot in modularization, implementation, and availability. In addition, the recommendation performance is further enhanced.
